This repository contains solutions to four programming challenges implemented using Node.js.
##  Tech Stack
- Node.js
- JavaScript (ES6)
- File System (fs module)
- Readline module
## Challenge-1: Approximate Word Search (Levenshtein Distance)

### Description:
This program loads a list of words from a text file and allows the user to search for similar words using Levenshtein Distance (edit distance algorithm).

It returns the top 3 most similar words to the given input.

### Files:
- index.js
- words.txt
### How to Run:
1. Navigate to the Challenge-1 folder:
   cd Challenge-1

2. Run:
   node index.js

3. Type a word and press Enter.
4. Type "exit" to quit.


#Challenge-2: File-Based Processing Program

### Description:
This challenge reads input from a file, processes the data according to the problem logic, and writes the result to an output file.

### Files:
- solver.js
- input.txt
- output.txt

### How to Run:
1. Navigate to the Challenge-2 folder:
   cd Challenge-2

2. Run:
   node solver.js

3. Check output.txt for results.


###Challenge-3: Palindrome Checker

### Description:
This program checks whether a given word or string is a palindrome.
A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.

Example:
- "madam" → Palindrome
- "hello" → Not a palindrome

### Files:
- palindrome-checker.js 

### How to Run:
1. Navigate to the Challenge-3 folder:
   cd Challenge-3

2. Run:
   node palindrome-checker.js

3. Enter a word to check.

Challenge-4: Binary Search Program

### Description:
This program demonstrates the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm on a predefined sorted array.

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

The program:
- Uses a predefined sorted array
- Prompts the user to enter a target number
- Searches for the element using Binary Search
- Displays the index if found, otherwise shows a "not found" message

### Files:
- binary-search.js 
### How to Run:
1. Navigate to the Challenge-4 folder:
   cd Challenge-4

2. Run:
   node binary-search.js

3. Enter a number when prompted.

### Example:

Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]

Input:
Enter the target element: 7

Output:
Element 7 is found at index 3
